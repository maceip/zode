"""check_artifacts.py — prove the release artifacts are complete.

A release once shipped a bare `Zode.Shell.exe`.  It was the ~520 KB apphost
launcher of a self-contained publish, so it downloaded fine and then did
nothing at all: the ~100 MB of .NET runtime files and the `web/` folder were
not next to it.

This script is the guard against that class of mistake.  It opens every
artifact that is about to be published and checks that the pieces the app
needs at runtime are actually inside it.

    python3 scripts/check_artifacts.py artifacts/*

It is deliberately platform independent: the `.zip` and the `.apk` are zip
files, and the `.dmg` is read with 7z when it is available.
