"""Validate the release tooling: the workflow, the installer source, the scripts.

None of this needs a Mac, a Windows box or an Apple account — it is a static
check that the release pipeline is wired together and that the files it
depends on exist and are well formed.  A mistake here only shows up as a red
CI run hours later, so it is worth catching now.

Run it directly, or through scripts/verify.sh.
